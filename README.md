# Water Level Monitoring using ESP8266 and Ultrasonic Sensor

## 📌 Overview
This project is an IoT-based water level monitoring system built using the ESP8266 and an ultrasonic sensor.  
It continuously measures the water level in a tank and helps prevent overflow and water wastage.

## ⚙️ Hardware Components
- ESP8266 (NodeMCU)
- Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
- Jumper wires
- Power supply

---

## 💻 Software & Tools
- Arduino IDE
- ESP8266 board package
- Ultrasonic sensor library (if used)

---

## 🔁 Working Principle
1. The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance between the sensor and the water surface.  
2. ESP8266 processes the distance data to calculate the water level.  
3. The water level can be monitored in real time through serial output or an IoT interface.
